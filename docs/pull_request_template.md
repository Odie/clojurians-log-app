Thank you for submitting a pull request! Someone will review your code, and if it all looks good, it will get merged.

People are granted commit right after they make a valuable contribution, but this does not mean you can push to master or merge your own commits. It does mean you can review other people's commits, and merge them if they look good.

Please give people a few days to respond. If you don't get any response within a few days, try politely asking people directly. Start with people who have worked on the same files/features, or who generally seem active here. If nobody responds, then ping @plexus :)
